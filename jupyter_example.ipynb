A specific width and heigh could be specified instead of the automatic layout. Th rest of the `<layout>` section specifies that the perimeter will hav `io` blocks, the corners will be `EMPTY` and the rest of the FPGA will be filled with `clb` blocks. `io` and `clb` blocks are defined in the `<complexblocklist>` section.\n",
