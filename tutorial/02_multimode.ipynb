    "# Multimode CLB\n",
    "In the I/O section of the architecture, the `<mode>` tag was used to define different modes for the block. One mode was for input, the other mode for output. Modes are also used in CLBs. Open the file `OpenFPGA/tutorial/02_multimode_arch.xml`. It defines two modes for its CLB: a 6-LUT, or two 5-LUTs with shared inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the line `<pb_type name=\"clb\" area=\"53894\">` which begins the definition of the CLB. The next few lines define the inputs and outputs: 40 input pins, 20 output pins, and a clock pin. The inputs are marked with `equivalent=\"full\"` which indicates that the inputs have logical equivalence so their locations may be freely swapped. The outputs are `equivalent=\"none\"` so they may not be swapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next primitive block is `<pb_type name=\"fle\" num_pb=\"10\">` which is a fracturable logic element that contains the two different modes of this CLB. There are 10 of this `fle` in the CLB. Each `fle` has 6 inputs, 2 outputs, and one clock pin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First Mode\n",
    "`<mode name=\"n2_lut5\">` begins the definition of the first mode. Moving down the architecture file, we see that in this mode, the `fle` contains one `lut5inter` block which contains two `ble5` blocks. The `ble5` blocks have 5 inputs and 1 output. The next group of lines define the LUT and FF in `ble5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving down to the second `<interconnect>` block:\n",
    "```\n",
    "<interconnect>\n",
    "  <direct name=\"direct1\" input=\"lut5inter.in\" output=\"ble5[0:0].in\"/>\n",
    "  <direct name=\"direct2\" input=\"lut5inter.in\" output=\"ble5[1:1].in\"/>\n",
    "  <direct name=\"direct3\" input=\"ble5[1:0].out\" output=\"lut5inter.out\"/>                 \n",
    "  <complete name=\"complete1\" input=\"lut5inter.clk\" output=\"ble5[1:0].clk\"/>                  \n",
    "</interconnect>\n",
    "```\n",
    "we see that the input of `lut5inter` is connected to the inputs of both the first and second `ble5` blocks. Then the two outputs of the two `ble5` blocks go to the two outputs of `lut5inter`. Finally, there is a fully connected crossbar that connects the `lut5inter` clock input to the two `ble5` clock inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finishing out this mode, there is the last interconnect section. Note the line: `<direct name=\"direct1\" input=\"fle.in[4:0]\" output=\"lut5inter.in\"/>`. It shows that out of the 6 `fle` input lines, only the first 5 lines are connected to `lut5inter`. The remaining line is unused.\n",
