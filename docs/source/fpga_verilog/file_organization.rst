Hierarchy of Verilog Output Files
============================

All the generated Verilog Netlists are located in the <verilog_dir> as you specify in the command-line options. Under the <verilog_dir>, FPGA-Verilog creates the top file name_top.v and a number of folders: lb (logic blocks), routing and sub_modules.

   "name_top.v", "Contains the top module and calls all the other .v files"   
   "lb", "Logic Block. Contains all the CLBs. The logic_block.v includes all the CLB and is called by the top module afterward"
   "routing", "Contains all the routing in the circuit. You can find in it the Switch Boxes, the Connection Blocks and the routing needed to connect the different blocks together. The routing.v file packs them all and is called by the top module"
   "sub_modules", "Contains the modules generated by the flow to build the CLBs"
